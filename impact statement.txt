Resistance to parasites in natural systems is often hastily interpreted as affecting host fitness. Yet understanding coupling between resistance and tolerance is needed before drawing conclusions on health effects of parasitism. Using four laboratory inbred strains of two house mouse subspecies, we found a trade-off between resistance and tolerance to E. falciformis, but not to the close relative E. ferrisi. Our work provides ground to reconsider how to link hybrid resistance against parasites to actual impact on species barriers, and more generally shows the importance of studying both these defense mechanisms jointly.
