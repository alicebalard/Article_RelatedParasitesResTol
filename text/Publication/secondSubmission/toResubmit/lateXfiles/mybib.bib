	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been well-established, both by population genetics theory and direct observation in many organisms, that increased genetic diversity provides a survival advantage. However, given the limitations of both sample size and genome-wide metrics, this hypothesis has not been comprehensively tested in human populations. Moreover, the presence of numerous segregating small effect alleles that influence traits that directly impact health directly raises the question as to whether global measures of genomic variation are themselves associated with human health and disease.
RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of 17 cohorts followed prospectively, with a combined sample size of 46,716 individuals, including a total of 15,234 deaths. We find a significant association between increased heterozygosity and survival (P = 0.03). We estimate that within a single population, every standard deviation of heterozygosity an individual has over the mean decreases that person's risk of death by 1.57\%.
CONCLUSIONS: This effect was consistent between European and African ancestry cohorts, men and women, and major causes of death (cancer and cardiovascular disease), demonstrating the broad positive impact of genomic diversity on human survival.},

Three decades ago, we mapped a mammalian speciation gene, hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1), in the intersubspecific hybrids of house mouse. Here, we identify this gene as Prdm9, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 trimethyltransferase. We rescued infertility in male hybrids with bacterial artificial chromosomes carrying Prdm9 from a strain with the “fertility” Hst1f allele. Sterile hybrids display down-regulated microrchidia 2B (Morc2b) and fail to compartmentalize γH2AX into the pachynema sex (XY) body. These defects, seen also in Prdm9-null mutants, are rescued by the Prdm9 transgene. Identification of a vertebrate hybrid sterility gene reveals a role for epigenetics in speciation and opens a window to a hybrid sterility gene network.
A gene responsible for sterility in the offspring of two mouse species, and therefore important in speciation, regulates gene expression via methylation in chromation.

Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic incompatibilities between diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is "easier" to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation.},

	abstract = {The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA–binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in metazoans.},

	abstract = {Resolving the mechanistic and genetic bases of reproductive barriers between species is essential to understanding the evolutionary forces that shape speciation. Intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities are often treated as fixed between species, yet there can be considerable variation in the strength of reproductive isolation between populations. The extent and causes of this variation remain poorly understood in most systems. We investigated the genetic basis of variable hybrid male sterility (HMS) between two recently diverged subspecies of house mice, Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus. We found that polymorphic HMS has a surprisingly complex genetic basis, with contributions from at least five autosomal loci segregating between two closely related wild-derived strains of M. m. musculus. One of the HMS-linked regions on chromosome 4 also showed extensive introgression among inbred laboratory strains and transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in hybrid crosses. Using additional crosses and whole genome sequencing of sperm pools, we showed that TRD was limited to hybrid crosses and was not due to differences in sperm motility between M. m. musculus strains. Based on these results, we argue that TRD likely reflects additional incompatibilities that reduce hybrid embryonic viability. In some common inbred strains of mice, selection against deleterious interactions appears to have unexpectedly driven introgression at loci involved in epistatic hybrid incompatibilities. The highly variable genetic basis to F1 hybrid incompatibilities between closely related mouse lineages argues that a thorough dissection of reproductive isolation will require much more extensive sampling of natural variation than has been commonly utilized in mice and other model systems.},

	abstract = {We have analyzed the sterility associated with introgressions of the distal one-fourth of the X chromosome from either Drosophila mauritiana or Drosophila sechellia into the genome of Drosophila simulans using a series of visible and DNA markers. Because in Drosophila hybrids, male sterility is usually complete and is often tightly linked with each of several markers used in crosses, a simple genetic basis has generally been assumed. In our low resolution mapping experiment, we were not able to reject the null hypothesis that a single gene, introgressed from either D. mauritiana or D. sechellia, is the cause of male sterility. High resolution mapping, however, reveals a much more complex picture. At least three distinct factors from D. mauritiana, or two from D. sechellia, were identified that need to be jointly present to confer full sterility. Each individual factor by itself is relatively ineffective in causing sterility, or even a partial spermatogenic defect. Moreover, there appear to be more sterility factors on comparable introgressions from D. mauritiana than from D. sechellia. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model which suggests that multilocus weak allele interactions are a very common cause of reproductive incompatibility between closely related species. We also present theoretical argument and empirical evidence against extrapolating the results of within-species analysis to interpret the genetic basis of species differences. The implications of this model on the theories of evolution of species differences and the attempt to understand the mechanisms of hybrid sterility/inviability at the molecular level are discussed.},

	abstract = {To study the genetic differences responsible for the sterility of their male hybrids, we introgressed small segments of an X chromosome from Drosophila simulans into a pure Drosophila mauritiana genetic background, then assessed the fertility of males carrying heterospecific introgressions of varying size. Although this analysis examined less than 20\% of the X chromosome (roughly 5\% of the euchromatic portion of the D. simulans genome), and the segments were introgressed in only one direction, a minimum of four factors that contribute to hybrid male sterility were revealed. At least two of the factors exhibited strong epistasis: males carrying either factor alone were consistently fertile, whereas males carrying both factors together were always sterile. Distinct spermatogenic phenotypes were observed for sterile introgressions of different lengths, and it appeared that an interaction between introgressed segments also influenced the stage of spermatogenic defect. Males with one category of introgression often produced large quantities of motile sperm and were observed copulating, but never inseminated females. Evidently these two species have diverged at a large number of loci which have varied effects on hybrid male fertility. By extrapolation, we estimate that there are at least 40 such loci on the X chromosome alone. Because these species exhibit little DNA-sequence divergence at arbitrarily chosen loci, it seems unlikely that the extensive functional divergence observed could be due mainly to random genetic drift. Significant epistasis between conspecific genes appears to be a common component of hybrid sterility between recently diverged species of Drosophila. The linkage relationships of interacting factors could shed light on the role played by epistatic selection in the dynamics of the allele substitutions responsible for reproductive barriers between species.},

Colonization of a novel antigenic environment by a species would be expected to alter the immune system. Animals that successfully adapt their immune responses will successfully colonize new locations. However, founder events associated with colonization by limited numbers of individuals from a source population will constrain adaptability. How these contradicting forces shape immunity in widely distributed species is unknown. The western house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) spread globally from the Indo-Pakistani cradle, often in association with human migration and settlement. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that wild-derived outbred laboratory populations of house mice from their original range (Iran) and historically recent European invasive populations (from France and Germany) present differences in immune functional diversity corresponding to recent historical founder events in Europe and movement to novel antigenic environments. We found that (1) European mice had lower total white blood cell (WBC) counts but higher immunoglobulin E concentrations than their Iranian counterparts, and (2) there were no significant differences in the measured immunological parameters among European populations. The results indicate that founder events in European mice and selection pressure exerted by the composition of local parasitic helminth communities underlie the observed patterns.},

For these reasons and because they are mammals, house mice are well suited to serve as models for human phenotypes and disease. House mice in the wild consist of at least three distinct subspecies and harbor extensive genetic and phenotypic variation both within and between these subspecies. Wild mice have been used to study a wide range of biological processes, including immunity, cancer, male sterility, adaptive evolution, and non-Mendelian inheritance. Despite the extensive variation that exists among wild mice, classical laboratory strains are derived from a limited set of founders and thus contain only a small subset of this variation. Continued efforts to study wild house mice and to create new inbred strains from wild populations have the potential to strengthen house mice as a model system.},

This work has had its roots in behavioural/evolutionary ecology on the one hand, and in population biology/ecology on the other, thus shaping a new comprehensive field of ‘evolutionary parasitology’. Taking parasites into account has been a success story and has shed new light on several old questions such as sexual selection, the evolution of sex and recombination, changes in behaviour, adaptive life histories, and so forth. In the process, the topic of ecological immunology has emerged, which analyses immune defences in a framework of costs and benefits. Throughout, a recurrent theme is how to appropriately integrate the underlying mechanisms as evolved boundary conditions into a framework of studying the adaptive value of traits. On the conceptual side, major questions remain and await further study.},

Study sites spanned 23 countries, and research teams brought together an average of seven authors from two countries. Surveillance of blood-borne and gastrointestinal protozoa were most frequently reported (19 of 32; 59\%), followed by trematodes, nematodes, and cestodes. Laboratory techniques varied greatly between studies, and only 16 identified parasites using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in all three OH domains. Our review identified important gaps in parasitology research operating under an OH framework.

	abstract = {In the early stages of reproductive isolation, genomic regions of reduced recombination are expected to show greater levels of differentiation, either because gene flow between species is reduced in these regions or because the effects of selection at linked sites within species are enhanced in these regions. Here, we study the patterns of DNA sequence variation at 27 autosomal loci among populations of Mus musculus musculus, M. m. domesticus, and M. m. castaneus, three subspecies of house mice with collinear genomes. We found that some loci exhibit considerable shared variation among subspecies, while others exhibit fixed differences. We used an isolation-with-gene-flow model to estimate divergence times and effective population sizes (Ne) and to disentangle ancestral variation from gene flow. Estimates of divergence time indicate that all three subspecies diverged from one another within a very short period of time approximately 350 000 years ago. Overall, Ne for each subspecies was associated with the degree of genetic differentiation: M. m. musculus had the smallest Ne and the greatest proportion of monophyletic gene genealogies, while M. m. castaneus had the largest Ne and the smallest proportion of monophyletic gene genealogies. M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus were more differentiated from each other than either were from M. m. castaneus, consistent with greater reproductive isolation between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. FST was significantly greater at loci experiencing low recombination rates compared to loci experiencing high recombination rates in comparisons between M. m. castaneus and M. m. musculus or M. m. domesticus. These results provide evidence that genomic regions with less recombination show greater differentiation, even in the absence of chromosomal rearrangements.},

Here, we conduct a survey of DNA-sequence polymorphism and divergence at loci on the autosomes, X chromosome, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA in samples of Mus domesticus, M. musculus and M. castaneus. We analyzed our data under a divergence with gene flow model and estimate that the effective population size of M. castaneus is 200 000–400 000, of M. domesticus is 100 000–200 000 and of M. musculus is 60 000–120 000. These data also suggest that these species started to diverge approximately 500 000 years ago. Consistent with this recent divergence, we observed considerable variation in the genealogical patterns among loci. For some loci, all alleles within each species formed a monophyletic group, while at other loci, species were intermingled on the phylogeny of alleles. This intermingling probably reflects both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow after divergence. Likelihood ratio tests rejected a strict allopatric model with no gene flow in comparisons between each pair of species. Gene flow was asymmetric: no gene flow was detected into M. domesticus, while significant gene flow was detected into both M. castaneus and M. musculus. Finally, most of the gene flow occurred at autosomal loci, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of fixed differences to polymorphisms at the X and Y chromosomes relative to autosomes in some comparisons, or just the X chromosome in others, emphasizing the important role of the sex chromosomes in general and the X chromosome in particular in speciation.},

	abstract = {Tolerance and resistance provide hosts with two distinct defense strategies against parasitism. In resistance the hosts “fight” the parasite directly, whereas in tolerance the hosts fight the disease by ameliorating the damage that infection causes. There is increasing recognition that the two mechanisms may exhibit very different evolutionary behaviors. Although empirical work has often noted considerable variance in tolerance within hosts, theory has predicted the fixation of tolerance due to positive frequency dependence through a feedback with disease prevalence. Here we reconcile these findings through a series of dynamic game theoretical models. We emphasize that there is a crucial distinction between tolerance to the effects of disease-induced mortality and tolerance to the effect of the disease-induced reductions in fecundity. Only mortality tolerance has a positive effect on parasite fitness, whereas sterility tolerance is neutral and may therefore result in polymorphisms. The nature of the costs to defense and their relationship to trade-offs between resistance and tolerance are crucial in determining the likelihood of variation, whereas the co-evolution of the parasite will not affect diversity. Our findings stress that it is important to measure the effects of different mechanisms on characteristics that affect the epidemiology of the parasite to completely understand the evolutionary dynamics of defense.},

Lactation is costly and requires increased food intake. In spotted hyaenas, energy expenditure on lactation is high, particularly for mothers rearing twin litters, and foraging effort and food intake are influenced by social status. We investigated whether lactation in this species results in a reduction in resource allocation to immune processes sufficient to increase parasite infection. We expected higher parasite infection in lactating than non-lactating females, in mothers nursing twin than singleton litters, in females of lower than higher social status and in less than more experienced foragers. We quantified Ancylostoma egg load (AEL) and the presence of oocysts of Cystoisospora spp. as a proxy measure of immune function in 58 females. Lactating females were significantly more often infected with Ancylostoma, and their AEL was higher than in non-lactating females. Females nursing twins had significantly higher AELs than those nursing singletons. As social status increased, AELs significantly declined. This relationship was modulated by lactation status and litter size, being strongest in non-lactating females, moderate in females with twin litters and weakest in females with singleton litters. The decrease in AEL with increasing social status was greater for experienced than inexperienced females. Concurrent infection with Cystoisospora significantly increased with increasing AEL.

	abstract = {Hosts are likely to respond to parasitic infections by a combination of resistance (expulsion of pathogens) and tolerance (active mitigation of pathology). Of these strategies, the basis of tolerance in animal hosts is relatively poorly understood, with especially little known about how tolerance is manifested in natural populations. We monitored a natural population of field voles using longitudinal and cross-sectional sampling modes and taking measurements on body condition, infection, immune gene expression, and survival. Using analyses stratified by life history stage, we demonstrate a pattern of tolerance to macroparasites in mature compared to immature males. In comparison to immature males, mature males resisted infection less and instead increased investment in body condition in response to accumulating burdens, but at the expense of reduced reproductive effort. We identified expression of the transcription factor Gata3 (a mediator of Th2 immunity) as an immunological biomarker of this tolerance response. Time series data for individual animals suggested that macroparasite infections gave rise to increased expression of Gata3, which gave rise to improved body condition and enhanced survival as hosts aged. These findings provide a clear and unexpected insight into tolerance responses (and their life history sequelae) in a natural vertebrate population. The demonstration that such responses (potentially promoting parasite transmission) can move from resistance to tolerance through the course of an individual’s lifetime emphasises the need to incorporate them into our understanding of the dynamics and risk of infection in the natural environment. Moreover, the identification of Gata3 as a marker of tolerance to macroparasites raises important new questions regarding the role of Th2 immunity and the mechanistic nature of the tolerance response itself. A more manipulative, experimental approach is likely to be valuable in elaborating this further.},

Infection dynamics, in turn, may be dependent on the underlying condition of hosts. There is a clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition and so on. To provide empirical data that support this notion, we measured haematological indicators of infection (neutrophils and monocytes) and condition (red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes) in field voles from three populations sampled monthly for 2 years. Mixed-effect models were developed to evaluate two hypotheses, (i) that individuals with low lymphocyte and/or RBC levels are more prone to show elevated haematological indicators of infection when re-sampled four weeks later, and (ii) that a decline in indicators of condition is likely to follow the development of monocytosis or neutrophilia. We found that individuals with low RBC and lymphocyte counts had increased probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in neutrophils, and that high indices of infection (neutrophilia and monocytosis) were generally followed by a declining tendency in the indicators of condition (RBCs and lymphocytes). The vicious circle that these results describe suggests that while pathogens overall may be more important in wildlife dynamics than has previously been appreciated, specific pathogens are likely to play their part as elements of an interactive web rather than independent entities.},

We exploited the transient pulmonary phase of N. brasiliensis development to study the innate immune responses induced by this helminth parasite in wild-type (WT) and severe-combined immune deficient (SCID) BALB/c mice. Histological analysis demonstrated that the cellular infiltrates caused by N. brasiliensis transit through the lungs were quickly resolved in WT mice but not in SCID mice. Microarray-based gene expression analysis demonstrated that there was a rapid induction of genes encoding molecules that participate in innate immunity and in repair/remodeling during days 2 to 4 postinfection in the lungs of WT and SCID mice. Of particular note was the rapid upregulation in both WT and SCID mice of the genes encoding YM1, FIZZ1, and Arg1, indicating a role for alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) in pulmonary innate immunity. Immunohistochemistry revealed that nearly all alveolar macrophages became YM1-producing AAMs as early as day 2 postinfection. While the innate responses induced during the lung phase of N. brasiliensis infection were similar in complexity and magnitude in WT and SCID mice, only mice with functional T cells were capable of maintaining elevated levels of gene expression beyond the innate window of reactivity. The induction of alternatively activated alveolar macrophages could be important for dampening the level of inflammation in the lungs and contribute to the long-term decrease in pulmonary inflammation that has been associated with helminth infections.},

The level of impairment can be pronounced in hybrids between genetically divergent populations. To explore the effect of hybridization on sperm quality we produced F1 hybrids from 29 wild derived strains of two house mouse subspecies, \textit{M. m. musculus} and \textit{M. m. domesticus}, which diverged 0.5 MY ago. The measured sperm quality traits did not significantly differ between intrasubspecific crosses. Effects of intersubspecific hybridization were dependent on sperm trait and cross direction. The proportion of sperm head abnormalities was increased in F1 intersubspecific hybrids. The frequency of dissociated sperm heads was increased in the \textit{M. m. musculus} × \textit{M. m. domesticus} (♀×♂) F1 but decreased in \textit{M. m. domesticus} × \textit{M. m. musculus} (♀×♂) F1 hybrids, with the difference in medians being more than 180\%. We deduce that the dissociated sperm heads trait is associated with the X chromosome and modulated by interaction with the Y chromosome; nevertheless, the high proportion of unexplained variance (55.46 \%) suggests the presence of polymorphic autosomal interactions. The reported differences in sperm quality between cross types may be highly relevant to male fitness in zones of secondary contact between the two subspecies. The cross direction asymmetry in frequency of dissociated sperm heads should favour the \textit{M. m. musculus} Y chromosome. This is consistent with the spread of the \textit{M. m. musculus} Y chromosome in nature across the hybrid zone between these two subspecies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The roles of Th1 and Th17 responses as mediators of host protection and pathology in the intestine are the subjects of intense research. In this study, we investigated a model of intestinal inflammation driven by the intracellular apicomplexan parasite Eimeria falciformis. Although IFN-γ was the predominant cytokine during E. falciformis infection in wild-type mice, it was found to be dispensable for host defense and the development of intestinal inflammation. E. falciformis-infected IFN-γR(-/-) and IFN-γ(-/-) mice developed dramatically exacerbated body weight loss and intestinal pathology, but they surprisingly harbored fewer parasites. This was associated with a striking increase in parasite-specific IL-17A and IL-22 production in the mesenteric lymph nodes and intestine. CD4(+) T cells were found to be the source of IL-17A and IL-22, which drove the recruitment of neutrophils and increased tissue expression of anti-microbial peptides (RegIIIβ, RegIIIγ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Concurrent neutralization of IL-17A and IL-22 in E. falciformis-infected IFN-γR(-/-) mice resulted in a reduction in infection-induced body weight loss and inflammation and significantly increased parasite shedding. In contrast, neutralization of IL-22 alone was sufficient to increase parasite burden, but it had no effect on body weight loss. Treatment of an E. falciformis-infected intestinal epithelial cell line with IFN-γ, IL-17A, or IL-22 significantly reduced parasite development in vitro. Taken together, to our knowledge these data demonstrate for the first time an antiparasite effect of IL-22 during an intestinal infection, and they suggest that IL-17A and IL-22 have redundant roles in driving intestinal pathology in the absence of IFN-γ signaling.},

The extent and relevance of parasite-mediated host responses in vivo remains poorly studied, however. We utilized Eimeria falciformis, a parasite infecting the mouse intestinal epithelium, to identify and validate host determinants of parasite infection. Most prominent mouse genes induced during the onset of asexual and sexual growth of parasite comprise interferon γ (IFNγ)-regulated factors, e.g., immunity-related GTPases (IRGA6/B6/D/M2/M3), guanylate-binding proteins (GBP2/3/5/6/8), chemokines (CxCL9-11), and several enzymes of the kynurenine pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). These results indicated a multifarious innate defense (tryptophan catabolism, IRG, GBP, and chemokine signaling), and a consequential adaptive immune response (chemokine-cytokine signaling and lymphocyte recruitment). The inflammation- and immunity-associated transcripts were increased during the course of infection, following influx of B cells, T cells, and macrophages to the parasitized caecum tissue. Consistently, parasite growth was enhanced in animals inhibited for CxCr3, a major receptor for CxCL9-11 present on immune cells. Interestingly, despite a prominent induction, mouse IRGB6 failed to bind and disrupt the parasitophorous vacuole, implying an immune evasion by E. falciformis. Furthermore, oocyst output was impaired in IFNγ-R(-/-) and IDO1(-/-) mice, both of which suggest a subversion of IFNγ signaling by the parasite to promote its growth.},

	abstract = {The protist phylum Apicomplexa Levine, 1970, comprises {\textgreater}4000 described species, all obligate parasites, that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Within the phylum, the genus Eimeria Schneider, 1875, (Family Eimeriidae) is the most speciose lineage ({\textgreater}1800 species) of intracellular parasites found in all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates. All eimerians have direct life cycles that include both asexual (merogony) and sexual (gamogony) reproduction, the latter resulting in the production of resistant propagules, the oocysts, which are discharged into the environment by the infected host. Endogenous development usually occurs in epithelial or endothelial cells of the intestine or in related structures (e.g. gall bladder, bile ducts, renal tubular epithelium, esophageal epithelium, oviduct epithelium uterine wall epithelium, etc.). Some eimerian species are highly pathogenic, especially in domesticated animals, but some also in wild animal species. Key Concepts: Within the coccidia proper, the Family Eimeriidae comprises about 15 genera, including Eimeria; all are obligate intracellular parasites known to infect every animal group which has been examined for them. Untapped Biodiversity: The genus Eimeria, with {\textgreater}1800 described forms, may be the most speciose group of parasites on Earth, but it has been little studied in the Earth's app. 62 150 vertebrate species. It can be estimated that 98.6\% (or more) of the coccidian parasites of vertebrates are yet to be discovered, based on what we know through 2010. Our knowledge of the biodiversity of life on Earth is still badly incomplete, especially of the microbes that inhabit the seas, the soils and the bodies of ‘higher’ organisms that live in and on them. Parasitologists, and most other biologists in general, agree that parasites represent a large proportion of all living species and may, in fact, far exceed the total number of all ‘free-living’ forms. As human population increases and agricultural development continues to shrink/fragment natural ecosystems, food webs will be disrupted and new and more virulent strains of coccidia may be expected, especially when exacerbated by environmental stressors (pollution), global climate change and invasion of new parasites from edge-dwelling hosts.},

The enteric lesions, most pronounced at eight to ten days postinfection, were restricted mainly to the large intestine and consisted initially of both cryptal and absorptive epithelial cell destruction and submucosal edema. These changes were followed in 12 to 24 hours by a transient influx of neutrophils into the lamina propria followed by mononuclear cell infiltration which lasted for five to ten days. As the infective dose decreased, the inflammatory response occurred later and was less extensive. When seen, hemorrhage occurred seven to 11 days postinfection. In 50\% of the mice infected with 5,000 and 20,000 oocysts, varying degrees of a nonselective mucosal necrosis were seen at eight to 12 days postinfection. In mice infected with 500 oocysts, mucosal destruction was restricted to the epithelium. Neutrophils predominated when necrosis was extensive, otherwise, mononuclear cells were the main inflammatory cells. Two to three days following necrosis, crypt hyperplasia was marked and mucosal integrity was restored. Ulcers, some of which extended into the submucosa, healed by days 14 to 20. Localized granulomatous colitis, induced by trapped oocysts within the lamina propria, was seen until the experiment was terminated at 25 days postinfection.

Phylogenetic classification of rodent Eimeria suggested that some species have a broader host range than previously assumed. We explore whether Eimeria spp. infecting house mice are misclassified by the most widely used molecular markers due to a lack of resolution, or whether, instead, these parasite species are indeed infecting multiple host species. With the commonly used markers (18S/COI), we recovered monophyletic clades of E. falciformis and E. vermiformis from Mus that included E. apionodes identified in other rodent host species (Apodemus spp., Myodes glareolus, and Microtus arvalis). A lack of internal resolution in these clades could suggest the existence of a species complex with a wide host range infecting murid and cricetid rodents. We question, however, the power of COI and 18S markers to provide adequate resolution for assessing host specificity. In addition to the rarely used marker ORF470 from the apicoplast genome, we present multilocus genotyping as an alternative approach. Phylogenetic analysis of 35 nuclear markers differentiated E. falciformis from house mice from isolates from Apodemus hosts. Isolates of E. vermiformis from Mus are still found in clusters interspersed with non-Mus isolates, even with this high-resolution data. In conclusion, we show that species-level resolution should not be assumed for COI and 18S markers in coccidia. Host?parasite cospeciation at shallow phylogenetic nodes, as well as contemporary coccidian host ranges more generally, is still open questions that need to be addressed using novel genetic markers with higher resolution.},

	abstract = {Research on speciation and adaptive radiation has flourished during the past decades, yet factors underlying initiation of reproductive isolation often remain unknown. Parasites represent important selective agents and have received renewed attention in speciation research. We review the literature on parasite-mediated divergent selection in context of ecological speciation and present empirical evidence for three nonexclusive mechanisms by which parasites might facilitate speciation: reduced viability or fecundity of immigrants and hybrids, assortative mating as a pleiotropic by-product of host adaptation, and ecologically-based sexual selection. We emphasise the lack of research on speciation continuums, which is why no study has yet made a convincing case for parasite driven divergent evolution to initiate the emergence of reproductive isolation. We also point interest towards selection imposed by single versus multiple parasite species, conceptually linking this to strength and multifariousness of selection. Moreover, we discuss how parasites, by manipulating behaviour or impairing sensory abilities of hosts, may change the form of selection that underlies speciation. We conclude that future studies should consider host populations at variable stages of the speciation process, and explore recurrent patterns of parasitism and resistance that could pinpoint the role of parasites in imposing the divergent selection that initiates ecological speciation.},

Since its emergence, ecoimmunology has sparked constructive debate on a wide range of topics, from the molecular mechanics of immune responses to the role of immunity in shaping the evolution of life histories. To complement the symposium Methods and Mechanisms in Ecoimmunology and commemorate the inception of the Division of Ecoimmunology and Disease Ecology within the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, we appraise the origins of ecoimmunology, with a focus on its continuing and valuable integration with disease ecology. Arguably, the greatest contribution of ecoimmunology to wider biology has been the establishment of immunity as an integral part of organismal biology, one that may be regulated to maximize fitness in the context of costs, constraints, and complex interactions. We discuss historical impediments and ongoing progress in ecoimmunology, in particular the thorny issue of what ecoimmunologists should, should not, or cannot measure, and what novel contributions ecoimmunologists have made to the understanding of host-parasite interactions. Finally, we highlight some areas to which ecoimmunology is likely to contribute in the near future.},

	abstract = {The obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites, e.g. Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium species, induce an IFNγ-driven induction of host indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism in the kynurenine pathway. Induction of IDO1 supposedly depletes cellular levels of tryptophan in host cells, which is proposed to inhibit the in vitro growth of auxotrophic pathogens. In vivo function of IDO during infections, however, is not clear, let alone controversial. We show that Eimeria falciformis, an apicomplexan parasite infecting the mouse caecum, induces IDO1 in the epithelial cells of the organ, and the enzyme expression coincides with the parasite development. The absence or inhibition of IDO1/2 and of two downstream enzymes in infected animals is detrimental to the Eimeria growth. The reduced parasite yield is not due to a lack of an immunosuppressive effect of IDO1 in the parasitized IDO1−/− or inhibitor-treated mice because they did not show an accentuated Th1 and IFNγ response. Noticeably, the parasite development is entirely rescued by xanthurenic acid, a by-product of tryptophan catabolism inducing exflagellation in male gametes of Plasmodium in the mosquito mid-gut. Our data demonstrate a conceptual subversion of the host defense (IFNγ, IDO) by an intracellular pathogen for progression of its natural life cycle. Besides, we show utility of E. falciformis, a monoxenous parasite of a well appreciated host, i.e. mouse, to identify in vivo factors underlying the parasite-host interactions.},

Phenotypical analysis by fluorescence cytometry and T cell proliferation assay showed that already from day four post infection E. falciformis-specific lymphocytes were present in the MLN. The frequency of parasite-specific, IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ cells increased in this period by 9.8\% and 16.4\%, respectively. Infection experiments with IFN-γ deficient mice revealed that IFN-γ is involved in resistance to primary and secondary infection. Transfer of total MLNC from immune donors reduced the oocyst output by 65–74\%, as compared to the oocyst output of animals transferred with cells from naïve donors. Transfer of CD8+ cells inhibited parasite development resulting in a reduction of oocyst numbers by 42–64\%, whereas CD4+ cells showed no influence on resistance to reinfection.},

	abstract = {Differences in susceptibility of strains of mice to Eimeria ferrisi were observed by infecting eight strains of mice with six infectious dose levels and comparing the mortality rate among the strains for a period of 12 days. Mice of the C57BL/6 and HA/ICR strains were susceptible, and those of A/He, AKR, BALB/c, CBA, C3H/Anf, and DBA/2 strains were resistant to coccidial infection. Resistance was a dominant genetic expression, as indicated by the resistant response of F(1) hybrids of susceptible C57BL/6 and resistant CBA, C3H/Anf, or DBA/2 strains. An E. ferrisi infection in congenitally athymic nu/nu mice and phenotypically normal heterozygous nu/+ mice was used to determine how thymus-dependent immunoincompetence in cell-mediated immunity of the nu/nu mouse affected resistance to infection in a genetic background of the resistant BALB/c mouse. Results of primary and challenge infections in these two strains of mice suggested that resistance is thymus dependent. Furthermore, impairment of thymus-dependent cell-mediated immunity in resistant AKR mice by treatment with mouse antithymus serum led to partial susceptibility. However, susceptible C57BL/6 and HA/ICR strains are phenotypically normal mice, and previous evidence showed that C57BL/6 mice are not completely immunoincompetent in cell-mediated reactivity to coccidia. Collectively, our data show that cell-mediated immunity is necessary for resistance but may be subjected to modification by genetic expression of the host. The possible role of immune response genes in the control of coccidial immunity is discussed.},

	abstract = {Genetic studies have typically inferred the effects of human impact by documenting patterns of genetic differentiation and levels of genetic diversity among potentially isolated populations using selective neutral markers such as mitochondrial control region sequences, microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes within and between populations can only be reflected by coding genes. In vertebrates, growing evidence suggests that genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC variants influence many important biological traits, including immune recognition, susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, individual odours, mating preferences, kin recognition, cooperation and pregnancy outcome. These diverse functions and characteristics place genes of the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. MHC variability is believed to be maintained by pathogen-driven selection, mediated either through heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent selection. Up to now, most of our knowledge has derived from studies in humans or from model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions. Empirical support for selective mechanisms in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment is rare. In this review, I first introduce general information about the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of MHC variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on the evidence derived from free-ranging animal populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic variability with respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.},

Gamete wastage can be a problem for hybridizing species even when gene flow does not occur. Birds and mammals introduced for game purposes have hybridized with native populations, a process often facilitated by habitat modification. Further, translocation and stock enhancement programs can lead to loss of well-adapted genotypes. These problems increase as populations become fragmented and isolated, because finding mates is harder and habitat differences that bar reproduction are obliterated. What to do about hybridization is sometimes not obvious. Even if the problem is seen as important, often little can be done. Culling may be impossible because of difficulties in recognizing introgressed individuals. Wildlife biologists and managers should work to prevent introductions and translocations if hybridization problems cannot be ruled out. Further, wildlife professionals should educate the public about evolutionary aspects of introductions and translocations, including hybridization and introgression.},

	abstract = {Multilocus hybrid zone (HZ) studies predate genomics by decades. The power of early methods is becoming apparent and now large datasets are commonplace. Relating introgression along a chromosome to evolutionary process is challenging: although reduced introgression regions may indicate speciation genes, this pattern may be obscured by asymmetric introgression of linked invasive genes. Further, HZ movement may form salients and leave islands in its wake. Barton's concordance was proposed 24 years ago for assessing introgression where geographic patterns are complex. The geographic axis of introgression is replaced with the hybrid index. We compare this, a recently proposed genomic clines approach, and two-dimensional (2D) geographic analyses, for 24 X chromosome loci of 2873 mice from the central-European house mouse HZ. In 2D, 14 loci show linear contact, seven precisely matching previous studies. Four show introgression islands to the east of the zone, suggesting past westward zone movement, two show westward salients. Barton's concordance both recovers and refines this information. A region of reduced introgression on the central X is supported, despite X centromere-proximal male-biased westward introgression matching a westward 2D geographic salient. Genomic clines results are consistent regarding introgression asymmetries, but otherwise more difficult to interpret. Evidence for genetic conflict is discussed.},

	abstract = {The house mouse hybrid zone (HMHZ) is a species barrier thought to be maintained by a balance between dispersal and natural selection against hybrids. While the HMHZ is characterized by frequency discontinuities for some sex chromosome markers, there is an unexpected large-scale regional introgression of a Y chromosome across the barrier, in defiance of Haldane's rule. Recent work suggests that a major force maintaining the species barrier acts through sperm traits. Here, we test whether the Y chromosome penetration of the species barrier acts through sperm traits by assessing sperm characteristics of wild-caught males directly in a field laboratory set up in a Y introgression region of the HMHZ, later calculating the hybrid index of each male using 1401 diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found that both sperm count (SC) and sperm velocity were significantly reduced across the natural spectrum of hybrids. However, SC was more than rescued in the presence of the invading Y. Our results imply an asymmetric advantage for Y chromosome introgression consistent with the observed large-scale introgression. We suggest that selection on sperm-related traits probably explains a large component of patterns observed in the natural hybrid zone, including the Y chromosome penetration.},

Our study describes the simultaneous evolution of these two strategies of defense in a population of hosts submitted to a pathogen. We extended previous approaches by assuming that the two traits are independent (e.g., determined by two unlinked genes), by modeling different shapes of the costs of defenses, and by taking into account the demographic and epidemiological dynamics of the system. We provide novel predictions on the variability and the evolution of defenses. First, resistance and tolerance do not necessarily exclude each other; second, they should respond in different ways to changes in parameters that affect the epidemiology or the relative costs and benefits of defenses; and third, when comparing investments in defenses among different environments, the apparent associations among resistance, tolerance, and fecundity in the absence of parasites can lead to the false conclusion that only one defense trait is costly. The latter result emphasizes the problems of estimating trade‐offs and costs among natural populations without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.},

Surprisingly, most medical, parasitological and ecological texts dismiss the subject with unsupported statements to the effect that ‘successful’ parasite species evolve to be harmless to their hosts. Recently, however, several people have explored theoretical aspects of the population genetics of host-parasite associations; these authors conclude that such associations may be responsible for much of the genetic diversity found within natural populations, from blood group polymorphisms (Haldane, 1949) to protein polymorphisms in general (Clarke, 1975, 1976) and to histocompatibility systems (Duncan, Wakeland \& Klein, 1980). It has also been argued that pathogens may constitute the selective force responsible for the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction in animal and plant species (Jaenike, 1978; Hamilton, 1980, 1981, 1982; Bremermann, 1980).},

	abstract = {Background
The phylum Apicomplexa comprises important unicellular human parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Eimeria is the largest and most diverse genus of apicomplexan parasites and some species of the genus are the causative agent of coccidiosis, a disease economically devastating in poultry. We report a complete genome sequence of the mouse parasite Eimeria falciformis. We assembled and annotated the genome sequence to study host-parasite interactions in this understudied genus in a model organism host.

Results
The genome of E. falciformis is 44 Mb in size and contains 5,879 predicted protein coding genes. Comparative analysis of E. falciformis with Toxoplasma gondii shows an emergence and diversification of gene families associated with motility and invasion mainly at the level of the Coccidia. Many rhoptry kinases, among them important virulence factors in T. gondii, are absent from the E. falciformis genome. Surface antigens are divergent between Eimeria species. Comparisons with T. gondii showed differences between genes involved in metabolism, N-glycan and GPI-anchor synthesis. E. falciformis possesses a reduced set of transmembrane transporters and we suggest an altered mode of iron uptake in the genus Eimeria.

Conclusions
Reduced diversity of genes required for host-parasite interaction and transmembrane transport allow hypotheses on host adaptation and specialization of a single host parasite. The E. falciformis genome sequence sheds light on the evolution of the Coccidia and helps to identify determinants of host-parasite interaction critical for drug and vaccine development.

	abstract = {Detection and quantification of coccidia in studies of wildlife can be challenging. Therefore, prevalence of coccidia is often not assessed at the parasite species level in non-livestock animals. Parasite species – specific prevalences are especially important when studying evolutionary questions in wild populations. We tested whether increased host population density increases prevalence of individual Eimeria species at the farm level, as predicted by epidemiological theory. We studied free-living commensal populations of the house mouse (Mus musculus) in Germany, and established a strategy to detect and quantify Eimeria infections. We show that a novel diagnostic primer targeting the apicoplast genome (Ap5) and coprological assessment after flotation provide complementary detection results increasing sensitivity. Genotyping PCRs confirm detection in a subset of samples and cross-validation of different PCR markers does not indicate bias towards a particular parasite species in genotyping. We were able to detect double infections and to determine the preferred niche of each parasite species along the distal-proximal axis of the intestine. Parasite genotyping from tissue samples provides additional indication for the absence of species bias in genotyping amplifications. Three Eimeria species were found infecting house mice at different prevalences: Eimeria ferrisi (16.7\%; 95\% CI 13.2–20.7), E. falciformis (4.2\%; 95\% CI 2.6–6.8) and E. vermiformis (1.9\%; 95\% CI 0.9–3.8). We also find that mice in dense populations are more likely to be infected with E. falciformis and E. ferrisi. We provide methods for the assessment of prevalences of coccidia at the species level in rodent systems. We show and discuss how such data can help to test hypotheses in ecology, evolution and epidemiology on a species level.},

Number of oocysts produced per g feces each day and prepatent and patent periods were assessed for 4 eimerian parasites (Eimeria papillata, Eimeria vermiformis, Eimeria falciformis, and Eimeria ferrisi) using the 3 murine strains. The number of infections required to elicit a protective immune response was also determined for each coccidial species in BALB/c mice. We report the first description of patent infections in inbred immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice infected with E. papillata. Results indicate that during primary infections, parasite replication is under partial immunological control for all Eimeria species. However, the control is mechanistically different for E. papillata because the adaptive immune response does not contribute to the control of primary infections. Both coccidial species infecting intestinal villar epithelial cells (E. papillata and E. ferrisi) were affected by the beige mutation using parasite output as an indicator, whereas E. falciformis, which infects intestinal crypt cells, is not. BALB/c mice were more resistant to challenge infections with upper intestinal parasites (E. papillata and E. vermiformis) in comparison to challenge infections with lower intestinal and cecal parasites (E. falciformis and E. ferrisi).},

They measured 14.0 (12–18) × 11-0 (9–13) μm and had 12.5 (5–16) merozoites. Macrogamonts were first seen in 72 hr sections. Each young macrogamont had a large nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. Only one type of cytoplasmic granule appeared to be involved in the formation of the oocyst wall. Mature macrogamonts were 11.0 (5–14) × 10.0 (6–13) μm. Crescent-shaped bodies were observed in the parasitophorous vacuole of trophozoites and young macrogamonts. Early microgamonts were first recognized at 96 hr by the presence of darkly stained and irregularly shaped nuclei.

Five species of helminths were recovered but only one of these (Capillaria murissylvatici) was site-specific (Dungeness). Total species richness was therefore 5 at Dungeness and 4 at the other two sites. Mean species richness was 1.4, but in adult mice there was a pronounced difference between the sites, and an independent highly significant effect of season. Syphacia stroma and Corrigia vitta both showed marked differences between sites in respect of prevalence and abundance of infection. Capillaria murissylvatici was encountered at Dungeness mostly in the spring whereas seasonal changes in abundance of S. stroma were consistent across all three sites. Seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of Catenotaenia pusilla were compounded by differences between sites.

MtDNA was typed for 305 nucleotides in the control region, the Y chromosome for 834 base pairs (bp) in Zfy introns and 242 bp in Sry, a Zfy2 18-bp deletion, and two microsatellites. Apparent discrepancies exist between the distributions of the lineages of mtDNA and of the two major Y-chromosome lineages thus defined: some subspecies share the same mtDNA lineage but have different Y-chromosome lineages or vice versa. One microsatellite reveals a geographically clustered variation inside the distribution of each Y-chromosome lineage, showing that new Y-chromosome variants can rapidly spread locally. The two major Y-chromosome lineages have a divergence time only about one fourth of that between mtDNA lineages. Although this recent coalescence of the Y chromosomes between subspecies could partly be due to a lower ancestral polymorphism of the Y chromosome, it suggests that secondary introgression after the radiation of the subspecies might have occurred. There is evidence that the differentiation of the Y-chromosome lineages contributes to partial reproductive isolation between subspecies, and patterns of molecular evolution suggest that selection has played a role in the rapid spread across subspecies.},

	abstract = {We explored the transition of 13 X-linked markers across two separate portions of the house mouse hybrid zone, asking whether such a comparison can distinguish the effects of selection from random factors. A heuristic search in the likelihood landscape revealed more complex likelihood profiles for data sampled in two-dimensional (2D) space relative to data sampled along a linear transect. Randomized resampling of localities analyzed for individual loci showed that deletion of sites away from the zone center can decrease cline width estimates whereas deletion of sites close to the center can significantly increase the width estimates. Deleting localities for all loci resulted in wider clines if the number of samples from the center was limited. The results suggest that, given the great variation in width estimates resulting from inclusion/exclusion of sampling sites, the geographic sampling design is important in hybrid zone studies and that our inferences should take into account measures of uncertainty such as support intervals. The comparison of the two transects indicates cline widths are narrower for loci in the central part of the X chromosome, suggesting selection is stronger in this region and genetic incompatibilities may have at least partly common architecture in the house mouse hybrid zone.},

	abstract = {Detailed investigation of variation in genes involved in pathogen recognition is crucial for understanding co-evolutionary processes between parasites and their hosts. Triggering immediate innate response to invading microbes, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong presently among the best-studied receptors of vertebrate immunity. TLRs exhibit remarkable interspecific variation and also intraspecific polymorphism is well documented. In humans and laboratory mice, several studies have recently shown that single amino acid substitution may significantly alter receptor function. Unfortunately, data concerning polymorphism in free-living species are still surprisingly scarce. In this study, we analyzed the polymorphism of Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) over the Palearctic range of house mouse (Mus musculus). Our results reveal contrasting evolutionary patterns between the two recently (0.5 million years ago) diverged house mouse subspecies: M. m. domesticus (Mmd) and M. m. musculus (Mmm). Comparison with cytochrome b indicates strong directional selection in Mmd Tlr4. Throughout the whole Mmd western Palaearctic region, a single variant of the ligand-binding region is spread, encoded mainly by one dominant haplotype (71\% of Mmd). In contrast, Tlr4 in Mmm is much more polymorphic with several haplotypes at intermediate frequencies. Moreover, we also found clear signals of recombination between two principal haplogroups in Mmm, and we identified eight sites under positive selection in our dataset. Our results suggest that observed differences in Tlr4 diversity may be attributed to contrasting parasite-mediated selection acting in the two subspecies.},

We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.
Gene flow has occurred from Neandertals to humans of Eurasian descent, but not to Africans.

	abstract = {Geneland is a computer package that allows to make use of georeferenced individual multilocus genotypes for the inference of the number of populations and of the spatial location of genetic discontinuities between those populations. Main assumptions of the method are: (i) the number of populations is unknown and all values are considered a priori equally likely, (ii) populations are spread over areas given by a union of some polygons of unknown location in the spatial domain, (iii) Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is assumed within each population and (iv) allele frequencies in each population are unknown and treated as random variable either following the so-called Dirichlet model or Falush model. Different algorithms implemented in Geneland to perform inferences are first briefly presented. Then major running steps and outputs (i.e. histogram of number of populations and map of posterior probabilities of population membership) are illustrated from the analysis of a simulated data set, which was also produced by Geneland.},

The study was conducted in 20 mainland and 27 island populations in central Finland during May–September in 1999. Faecal samples showed that 28\% of 767 individuals were infected with Eimeria spp. The presence of Eimeria parasites was higher in dense mainland populations than in sparsely populated islands. Eimerian infections increased during the course of the breeding season, probably as a result of the high infection rate of young individuals. Accordingly, the body masses of bank voles were negatively related to the presence of Eimeria spp. Reproductive output, as measured by the breeding probability of females and litter size, was not associated with the presence of eimerian infection. Interestingly, the body condition of the infected mothers appeared to be low. Moreover, mother's body condition was the single most important variable studied that showed a positive correlation to pup's body condition at birth. On small islands ([les ]3·2 ha) that were comprehensively trapped, the mean number of Eimeria spp. in the bank vole population was negatively related to density changes of the bank vole population during the study. Our data are consistent with the idea that infection with coccidian parasites may be one of the factors responsible for declining host populations in small, isolated populations.},

	abstract = {(1) Population dynamics of vole helminths in Finnish Lapland were studied for a 10-year period covering a peak phase of a vole cycle (1977-78), an entire cycle (1980-85), and an increase phase of a third cycle (1986-87). The host material consists of 1032 bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus and 175 red voles Clethrionomys rutilus. (2) Age-prevalence relationships were analysed, as well as seasonal and long-term population dynamics of vole helminths with special reference to the various regulatory factors. (3) The common helminths (Heligmosomum mixtum, Nematoda, and Catenotaenia sp., Cestoda) were characterized by regular seasonal changes in prevalence and intensity, with the peak of infection occurring in winter. Generally, the density of C. glareolus did not determine the infection levels of common helminths. However, during the low and increase phase of a typical vole cycle the prevalence of common helminths followed those of the host (C. glareolus). (4) Compared to the common helminths, the rare species (Mastophorus muris, Capillaria sp., Syphacia petrusewiczi, Nematoda, and Paranoplocephala kalelai, Cestoda) showed quite different seasonal dynamics with a spring, summer or autumn peak in overwintered voles. Multi-annually they were less predictable than the common species. In addition, the dynamics of the rare helminths were not affected by the phases of low host density, probably because of their strictly seasonal occurrence and, consequently, long response times. (5) The regulation of common helminths seemed to be accomplished primarily at the level of host individuals, the role of the hosts' immunological mechanisms being important. The transmission was impaired only when extremely low host densities prevailed for long periods of time. No evidence of host mortality caused by common helminths was found. (6) The drastic seasonal variation in transmission efficiency was the dominant feature in the dynamics of rare helminths. The long-term results suggest that stochastic factors affecting the survival of infective stages, and hence transmission, may be more important for rare than common species. (7) The life histories (modes of feeding and reproduction, life cycles) of vole helminths did not determine the nature of their population dynamics and regulation. However, the common species were characterized by a low degree of aggregation, whereas all the rare nematodes were highly aggregated within the host population.},

	abstract = {In mammals, two factors likely to affect the diversity and composition of intestinal bacteria (bacterial microbiome) and eukaryotes (eukaryome) are social status and age. In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes.},

In several places the two distributions are separated by geographic barriers such as high mountain ridges and lowlands. The history of this XY chromosomal race is discussed in the light of the genetic dynamics of hybrid zones and the biogeography of this situation. Its origin is probably post-glacial, and it may be extending its range as a salient in one region. A comparison of the properties of similar cases indicates that the formation of such chromosomal races may be a frequent event in relatively immobile species that are subjected to isolation and expansion by major climatic and ecological changes.},

Five nuclear markers (Abpa, D11 cenB2, Btk, SMCY and Zfy2) and a morphological feature (tail length) were used to differentiate the two subspecies and assess their distributions, and mitochondrial (mt) D-loop sequences helped to elucidate their colonization history. M. m. domesticus is the more widespread of the two subspecies, occupying the western and southern coast of Norway, while M. m. musculus is found along Norway’s southeastern coast and east from there to Sweden. Two sections of the hybrid zone between the two subspecies were localized in Norway. However, hybrid forms also occur well away from that hybrid zone, the most prevalent of which are mice with a M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome and an otherwise M. m. domesticus genome. MtDNA D-loop sequences of the mice revealed a complex phylogeography within M. m. domesticus, reflecting passive human transport to Norway, probably during the Viking period. M. m. musculus may have colonized earlier. If so, that leaves open the possibility that M. m. domesticus replaced M. m. musculus from much of Norway, with the widely distributed hybrids a relict of this process. Overall, the effects of hybridization are evident in house mice throughout Norway.},

Such considerations stimulated a search for IRG alleles unknown in laboratory mice that might confer resistance to virulent strains of T. gondii. We report that the mouse IRG system shows extraordinary polymorphic complexity in the wild. We describe an IRG haplotype from a wild-derived mouse strain that confers resistance against virulent parasites by interference with the virulent kinase complex. In such hosts virulent strains can encyst, hinting at an explanation for the evolution of virulence polymorphism in T. gondii.},

	abstract = {We investigate the patterns of abundance-spatial occupancy relationships of adult parasite nematodes in mammal host populations (828 populations of nematodes from 66 different species of terrestrial mammals). A positive relationship between mean parasite abundance and host occupancy, i.e. prevalence, is found which suggests that local abundance is linked to spatial distribution across species. Moreover, the frequency distribution of the parasite prevalence is bimodal, which is consistent with a core-satellite species distribution. In addition, a strong positive relationship between the abundance (log-transformed) and its variance (log-transformed) is observed, the distribution of worm abundance being lognormally distributed when abundance values have been corrected for host body size. Hanski et al. proposed three distinct hypotheses, which might account for the positive relationship between abundance and prevalence in free and associated organisms: 1) ecological specialisation, 2) sampling artefact, and 3) metapopulation dynamics. In addition, Gaston and co-workers listed five additional hypotheses. Four solutions were not applicable to our parasitological data due to the lack of relevant information in most host-parasite studies. The fifth hypothesis, i.e. the confounded effects exerted by common history on observed patterns of parasite distributions, was considered using a phylogeny-based comparison method. Testing the four possible hypotheses, we obtained the following results: 1) the variation of parasite distribution across host species is not due to phylogenetic confounding effects; 2) the positive relationship between mean abundance and prevalence of nematodes may not result from an ecological specialisation, i.e. host specificity, of these parasites; 3) both a positive abundance-prevalence relationship and a negative coefficient of variation of abundance-prevalence relationship are likely to occur which corroborates the sampling model developed by Hanski et al. We argue that demographic explanations may be of particular importance to explain the patterns of bimodality of prevalence when testing Monte-Carlo simulations using epidemiological modelling frameworks, and when considering empirical findings. We conclude that both the bimodal distribution of parasite prevalence and the mean-variance power function simply result from demographic and stochastic patterns (highlighted by the sampling model), which present compelling evidence that nematode parasite species might adjust their spatial distribution and burden in mammal hosts for simple epidemiological reasons.},

In this study, we show the abundant B1 family of short interspersed DNA elements (SINEs) is a very promising source of such markers. Thirteen Bl sequences from different regions of the genome were retrieved on the basis of their high degree of homology to a mouse consensus sequence, and the presence of these elements was screened for in wild derived mice representing M. spretus, macedonicus and spicilegus and the different subspecies of M. musculus. At five of these loci, varying degrees of insertion polymorphism were found in M. m. domesticus mice. These insertions were almost totally absent in the mice representing the other subspecies and species. Six other Bl elements were fixed in all the Mus species tested. At these loci, polymorphism associated with three restriction sites in the Bl consensus sequence was found in M. musculus. Most of these polymorphisms appear to be ancestral as they are shared by at least one of the other Mus species tested. Both insertion and restriction polymorphism revealed differences between five inbred laboratory strains considered to be of mainly domesticus origin, and at the six restriction loci a surprising number of these strains carried restriction variants that were either not found or very infrequent in domesticus. This suggests that in this particular group of loci, allcles of far Eastern origin are more frequent than expected.},

Zfy divided the Y Chrs of these mice into domesticus- (domesticus) and musculus-types (musculus, castaneus, molossinus). M.m. bactrianus specimens had both Y Chrs, possibly owing to the introgression of a musculus-type Y into this population. Sry identified a subpopulation of musculus-type Y chromosomes. This subpopulation, designated the molossinus-type, was found in M.m. molossinus, a M. musculus subspecies specimen from northern China (Changchun), and laboratory mice. The cumulative data suggest that M.m. musculus of northern China and Korea are subpopulation distinct from M.m. musculus of Europe and central China and that this subpopulation invaded Japan, giving rise to M.m. molossinus. Furthermore, the data suggest that the musculus-type Y of the laboratory mouse originated from this subpopulation, corroborating early historical record reporting that Chinese and Japanese mice that were imported into Europe for the pet trade contributed to the genome of the laboratory mouse.},

	abstract = {Aggregated distributions among individual hosts are a defining feature of metazoan parasite populations. Heterogeneity among host individuals in exposure to parasites or in susceptibility to infection is thought to be the main factor generating aggregation, with properties of parasites themselves explaining some of the variability in aggregation levels observed among species. Here, using data from 410 samples of helminth parasites on fish hosts, I tested the contribution of (i) within-sample variation in host body size, taken as a proxy for variability in host susceptibility, and (ii) parasite taxon and developmental stage, to the aggregated distribution of parasites. Log-transformed variance in numbers of parasites per host was regressed against log mean number across all samples; the strong relationship (r2 = 0·88) indicated that aggregation levels are tightly constrained by mean infection levels, and that only a small proportion of the observed variability in parasite aggregation levels remains to be accounted for by other factors. Using the residuals of this regression as measures of ‘unexplained’ aggregation, a mixed effects model revealed no significant effect of within-sample variation in host body size or of parasite taxon or stage (i.e. juvenile versus adult) on parasite aggregation level within a sample. However, much of the remaining variability in parasite aggregation levels among samples was accounted for by the number of individual hosts examined per sample, and species-specific and study-specific effects reflecting idiosyncrasies of particular systems. This suggests that with most differences in aggregation among samples already explained, there may be little point in seeking universal causes for the remaining variation.},

The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the resulting changed and reduced pattern of exposure to microorganisms has led to disordered regulation of the immune system, and hence to increases in certain inflammatory disorders. The concept began with the allergic disorders, but there are now good reasons for extending it to autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease, neuroinflammatory disorders, atherosclerosis, depression associated with raised inflammatory cytokines, and some cancers. This review discusses these possibilities in the context of Darwinian medicine, which uses knowledge of evolution to cast light on human diseases. The Darwinian approach enables one to correctly identify some of the organisms that are important for the ‘Hygiene’ or ‘Old Friends’ hypothesis, and to point to the potential exploitation of these organisms or their components in novel types of prophylaxis with applications in several branches of medicine.},

	abstract = {Body condition can have important fitness consequences, but measuring body condition of live animals from wild populations has been the subject of much recent debate. Using the residuals from a regression of body mass on a linear measure of body size is one of the most common methods of measuring condition and has been used in many vertebrate taxa. Recently, the use of this method has been criticized because assumptions are likely violated. We tested several assumptions regarding the use of this method with body composition and morphometric data from five species of small mammals and with statistical simulations. We tested the assumptions that the relationship between body mass and body size is linear, and that the proportion of mass associated with energy reserves is independent of body size. In addition, we tested whether the residuals from reduced major axis (RMA) regression or major axis (MA) regression performed better than the residuals from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression as indices of body condition. We found no evidence of nonlinear relationships between body mass and body size. Relative energy reserves (fat and lean dry mass) were generally independent or weakly dependent on body size. Residuals from MA and RMA regression consistently explained less variation in body composition than OLS regression. Using statistical simulations, we compared the effects of violations of the assumption that true condition and residual indices are independent of body size on the OLS, MA, and RMA procedures and found that OLS performed better than the RMA and MA procedures. Despite recent criticisms of residuals from mass–size OLS regressions, these indices of body condition appear to satisfy critical assumptions. Although some caution is warranted when using residuals, especially when both interindividual variation in body size and measurement error are high, we found no reason to reject OLS residuals as legitimate indices of body condition.},

We base this survey on quantitative analyses of mean burden and a number of measures of the degree of aggregation of parasite burdens between hosts. All major parasite and vertebrate host taxa were represented in the database. Mean parasite burden was found to be log-normally distributed, indicating that all parasite burdens are regulated to some degree. In addition, all but one of the parasitic infections were aggregated with respect to their hosts, and the relationship between log mean parasite burden and log variance was found to be very strong (R2 = 0·87). That is, for a given mean parasite burden there are constraints on the degree of variation in individual host burdens. The aggregated nature of the parasitic infections is also apparent from other measures of the degree of aggregation: prevalence – mean relationships, and the negative binomial parameter, k. Using a relatively new technique for parasitological infection data – tree-based models, as well as traditional linear models – a number of the parasitic infections was found to be associated with systematically lower or higher parasite burdens. Possible biological explanations for these and other patterns are proposed.},

	abstract = {S is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data. Increased computational power allows even more computer-intensive methods to be used, and methods such as GLMMs,},

	abstract = {The relationship between the manifestations of tolerance (a host’s ability to reduce the impact of a given level of pathogens) and resistance (a host’s ability to clear pathogens) has been assumed to be an antagonistic one. Here we tested the hypothesis that mice from strains more resistant to intestinal nematodes will experience reduced tolerance compared with less resistant mice. Three inbred strains of mice were used: C57BL/6 mice have been characterised as susceptible, whereas BALB/c and NIH mice have been characterised as resistant to Heligmosomoides bakeri infection. Mice of each strain were either parasitised with a single dose of 250 L3 H. bakeri (n=10) in water or were sham-infected with water (n=10). Body weight, food intake and worm egg output were recorded regularly throughout the experiment. Forty-two days p.i. mice were euthanised and organ weights, eggs in colon and worm counts were determined. C57BL/6 mice showed significantly greater worm egg output (P{\textless}0.001), eggs in colon (P{\textless}0.05) and female worm fecundity (P{\textless}0.05) compared with NIH and BALB/c mice. Parasitised BALB/c mice grew more whilst parasitised C57BL/6 mice grew less than their sham-infected counterparts during the first 2weeks post-challenge (P=0.05). Parasitism significantly increased liver, spleen, small intestine and caecum weights (P{\textless}0.001) but reduced carcass weight (P{\textless}0.01). Average daily weight gain and worm numbers were positively correlated in NIH mice (P=0.05); however, the relationship was reversed when carcass weight was used as a measure for tolerance. BALB/c mice did not appear to suffer from the consequences of parasitism, with carcass weight similar in all animals. Our hypothesis that strains more resistant to the H. bakeri infection are less tolerant compared with less resistant strains is rejected, as the two resistant strains showed variable tolerance. Thus, tolerance and resistance to an intestinal nematode infection are not always mutually exclusive.},

	abstract = {Within-host interactions among coinfecting parasites are common and have important consequences for host health and disease dynamics. However, these within-host interactions have traditionally been studied in laboratory mouse models, which often exclude important variation and use unnatural host–parasite combinations. Conversely, the few wild studies of within-host interactions often lack knowledge of parasite exposure and infection history. Here we exposed laboratory-reared wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) that were derived from wild-caught animals to two naturally-occurring parasites (nematode: Heligmosomoides polygyrus, coccidia: Eimeria hungaryensis) to investigate the impact of coinfection on parasite infection dynamics, and to determine if the host immune response mediates this interaction. Coinfection led to delayed worm expulsion and prolonged egg shedding in H. polygyrus infections and lower peak E. hungaryensis oocyst burdens. By comparing antibody levels between wild and colony-housed mice, we also found that wild mice had elevated H. polygyrus-IgG1 titres even if currently uninfected with H. polygyrus. Using this unique wild-laboratory system, we demonstrate, for the first time, clear evidence for a reciprocal interaction between these intestinal parasites, and that there is a great discrepancy between antibody levels measured in the wild vs those measured under controlled laboratory conditions in relation to parasite infection and coinfection.},

	abstract = {In this study we present a simple optimization model for the evolution of defensive strategies (tolerance and resistance) of plants against their natural enemies. The model specifically evaluates the consequences of introducing variable costs and benefits of tolerance and resistance and nonlinear cost-and-benefit functions for tolerance and resistance. Incorporating these assumptions, the present model of plant defense predicts different evolutionary scenarios, not expected by previous work. Basically, the presence of an adaptive peak corresponding to intermediate levels of allocation to tolerance and resistance can arise when the shape parameter of the cost function is higher than the corresponding of the benefit function. The presence of two alternatives peaks of maximum tolerance and maximum resistance occurs only when benefits of tolerance and resistance interact less than additive. Finally, the presence of one peak of maximum resistance or maximum tolerance depends on the relative values of the magnitude of costs for tolerance and resistance. An important outcome of our model is that under a plausible set of conditions, variable costs of tolerance and resistance can represent an important aspect involved in the maintenance of intermediate levels of tolerance and resistance, and in favoring adaptive divergence in plant defensive strategies among populations. The model offers a framework for future theoretical and empirical work toward understanding spatial variation in levels of allocation to different defensive strategies.},

	abstract = {Defence against pathogenic infection can take two forms: resistance and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to limit a pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the negative consequences of infection at a given level of infection intensity. Evolutionarily, a tolerance strategy that is independent of resistance could allow the host to avoid mounting a costly immune response and, theoretically, to avoid a co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Biomedically, understanding the mechanisms of tolerance and how they relate to resistance could potentially yield treatment strategies that focus on health improvement instead of pathogen elimination. To understand the impact of tolerance on host defence and identify genetic variants that determine host tolerance, we defined genetic variation in tolerance as the residual deviation from a binomial regression of fitness under infection against infection intensity. We then performed a genomewide association study to map the genetic basis of variation in resistance to and tolerance of infection by the bacterium Providencia rettgeri. We found a positive genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance, and we demonstrated that the level of resistance is highly predictive of tolerance. We identified 30 loci that predict tolerance, many of which are in genes involved in the regulation of immunity and metabolism. We used RNAi to confirm that a subset of mapped genes have a role in defence, including putative wound repair genes grainy head and debris buster. Our results indicate that tolerance is not an independent strategy from resistance, but that defence arises from a collection of physiological processes intertwined with canonical immunity and resistance.},

Consistent with Haldane's rule, the Y chromosome has been considered counterselected and hence not to introgress across the European house mouse hybrid zone. However, recent studies detected massive invasion of M. m. musculus Y chromosomes into M. m. domesticus territory. To understand mechanisms facilitating Y spread, we created 31 recombinant lines from eight wild-derived strains representing four localities within the two mouse subspecies. These lines were reciprocally crossed and resulting F1 hybrid males scored for five phenotypic traits associated with male fitness. Molecular analyses of 51 Y-linked SNPs attributed 50\% of genetic variation to differences between the subspecies and 8\% to differentiation within both taxa. A striking proportion, 21\% (frequencies of sperm head abnormalities) and 42\% (frequencies of sperm tail dissociations), of phenotypic variation was explained by geographic Y chromosome variants. Our crossing design allowed this explanatory power to be examined across a hierarchical scale from subspecific to local intrastrain effects. We found that divergence and variation were expressed diversely in different phenotypic traits and varied across the whole hierarchical scale. This finding adds another dimension of complexity to studies of Y introgression not only across the house mouse hybrid zone but potentially also in other contact zones.},

	abstract = {Plants have numerous mechanisms to cope with the negative effects of herbivory, including plant resistance, structural and chemical traits that reduce damage, and plant tolerance, the ability to compensate for tissues lost. It has been argued that resistance and tolerance represent alternate strategies and thus there should be a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. However, resistance and tolerance are controlled via the same molecular pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the process of endoreduplication. Endoreduplication is the replication of the genome without mitosis, which leads to an increase in cellular chromosome number. Increasing chromosome number and therefore gene copy number provides a means of increasing gene expression that has been shown to enhance compensation following herbivory. By measuring glucosinolate levels and seed production following the removal of apical dominance in genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana we show that there is a positive association between tolerance and induced chemical defense. Similarly, the direct association between tolerance and resistance is demonstrated by genetically manipulating the endoreduplication pathway. By overexpressing ILP1, a positive regulator of endoreduplication, and thus compensation, we experimentally increased glucosinolate production and tolerance in the Col-0 genotype. We suggest that many herbaceous plants that endoreduplicate ( 90\%) would show a positive relationship between compensation and chemical defense, given that the molecular pathways are shared in common. We discuss these findings in light of contrasting results on measures of tolerance and resistance, given that the true relationship can be masked by ignoring genetic variation in endoreduplication and the timing of chemical measurement.},

Treatment with anti-CD4 Mab increased susceptibility to primary infections with E. vermiformis or E. pragensis and reduced the subsequent resistance of the mice to homologous challenge. Similar treatment of immune mice did not affect their resistance to re-infection but this was reduced in mice depleted of CD8+ T lymphocytes. In mice immunized with E. vermiformis the effect of CD8+-depletion was very slight, apparent only as the presence of small numbers of oocysts in the faeces of some mice; in mice immunized with E. pragensis there was a small, though significant, increase in oocyst production, compared with controls and anti-CD4-treated groups. These results confirm the importance of mechanisms involving the function of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the control of primary infections with Eimeria spp. and indicate that CD8+ cells play some part in the expression of resistance to reinfection. They also show that a major part of this resistance was not affected by either of the treatments given.},

	abstract = {Because most pathogens initially challenge the body at epithelial surfaces, it is important to dissect the mechanisms that underlie T-cell responses to infected epithelial cells in vivo. The coccidian parasites of the genus Eimeria are protozoan gut pathogens that elicit a potent, protective immune response in a wide range of host species. CD4+ αβ T cells and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) are centrally implicated in the primary immunoprotective response. To define any additional requirements for the primary response and to develop a comparison between the primary and the secondary response, we have studied Eimeria infections of a broad range of genetically altered mice. We find that a full-strength primary response depends on β2-microglobulin (class I major histocompatibility complex [MHC] and class II MHC and on IFN-γ and interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not on TAP1, perforin, IL-4, Fas ligand, or inducible nitric oxide synthetase. Indeed, MHC class II-deficient and IFN-γ-deficient mice are as susceptible to primary infection as mice deficient in all αβ T cells. Strikingly, the requirements for a highly effective αβ-T-cell-driven memory response are less stringent, requiring neither IFN-γ nor IL-6 nor class I MHC. The class II MHC dependence was also reduced, with adoptively transferable immunity developing in MHC class II−/− mice. Besides the improved depiction of an immune response to a natural gut pathogen, the finding that effective memory can be elicited in the absence of primary effector responses appears to create latitude in the design of vaccine strategies.},

	abstract = {Infected hosts may preserve fitness by resisting parasites (reducing parasite burden) and/or tolerating them (preventing or repairing infection-induced damage). Theory predicts that these individual-level defense strategies generate divergent population-level feedbacks that would maintain genetic heterogeneity for resistance but purge heterogeneity for tolerance. Because resistance reduces parasite abundance, selection for costly resistance traits will weaken as resistance becomes common. Such negative frequency-dependent selection contrasts with predictions for tolerance, which maintains parasite abundance and so is expected to generate positive frequency-dependent selection, unless, for example, tolerance trades off with resistance. Thus far, there have been few tests of this theory in natural systems. Here, we begin testing the predictions in a mammalian field system, using data on individual gastrointestinal nematode burdens, nematode-specific antibody titers (as a resistance metric), the slope of body weight on parasite burden (as a tolerance metric), and fitness from an unmanaged population of Soay sheep. We find that nematode resistance is costly to fitness and underpinned by genetic heterogeneity, and that resistance is independent of tolerance. Drawing upon empirical metrics such as developed here, future work will elucidate how resistance and tolerance feedbacks interact to generate population-scale patterns in the Soay sheep and other field systems.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a disease of great medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma (subclass Digenea). Following major water development schemes in the 1980s, schistosomiasis has become an important parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin (SRB). During molecular parasitological surveys, nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed unexpected natural interactions between a bovine and human Schistosoma species: S. bovis and S. haematobium, respectively. Hybrid schistosomes recovered from the urine and faeces of children and the intermediate snail hosts of both parental species, Bulinus truncatus and B. globosus, presented a nuclear ITS rRNA sequence identical to S. haematobium, while the partial mitochondrial cox1 sequence was identified as S. bovis. Molecular data suggest that the hybrids are not 1st generation and are a result of parental and/or hybrid backcrosses, indicating a stable hybrid zone. Larval stages with the reverse genetic profile were also found and are suggested to be F1 progeny. The data provide indisputable evidence for the occurrence of bidirectional introgressive hybridization between a bovine and a human Schistosoma species. Hybrid species have been found infecting B. truncatus, a snail species that is now very abundant throughout the SRB. The recent increase in urinary schistosomiasis in the villages along the SRB could therefore be a direct effect of the increased transmission through B. truncatus. Hybridization between schistosomes under laboratory conditions has been shown to result in heterosis (higher fecundity, faster maturation time, wider intermediate host spectrum), having important implications on disease prevalence, pathology and treatment. If this new hybrid exhibits the same hybrid vigour, it could develop into an emerging pathogen, necessitating further control strategies in zones where both parental species overlap.},

Interactions among co-infecting parasites may have important consequences for disease severity, transmission and community-level responses to perturbations. However, our current view of parasite interactions in nature comes primarily from observational studies, which may be unreliable at detecting interactions. We performed a perturbation experiment in wild mice, by using an anthelminthic to suppress nematodes, and monitored the consequences for other parasite species. Overall, these parasite communities were remarkably stable to perturbation. Only one non-target parasite species responded to deworming, and this response was temporary: we found strong, but short-lived, increases in the abundance of Eimeria protozoa, which share an infection site with the dominant nematode species, suggesting local, dynamic competition. These results, providing a rare and clear experimental demonstration of interactions between helminths and co-infecting parasites in wild vertebrates, constitute an important step towards understanding the wider consequences of similar drug treatments in humans and animals.},

However, while there are sound theoretical reasons to expect heterozygosity and parasite resistance to be related, this pattern has generally been shown only in inbred laboratory and island populations. This leaves doubt as to whether parasite-mediated selection for genetic diversity is in fact a general process. Here we show that haematozoan parasite load is linked to two complementary measures of microsatellite variability, in an outbred population of mountain white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) for which we know that parasites reduce fitness. Moreover, each of the genetic measures predicts a subtly different aspect of parasitism. Microsatellite heterozygosity is related to an individual's risk of parasitism, and mean d2 (a broader, more long-term measure of parental relatedness) to the severity of infection among parasitized individuals.},

	abstract = {A complete understanding of the speciation process requires the identification of genomic regions and genes that confer reproductive barriers between species. Empirical and theoretical research has revealed two important patterns in the evolution of reproductive isolation in animals: isolation typically arises as a result of disrupted epistatic interactions between multiple loci and these disruptions map disproportionately to the X chromosome. These patterns suggest that a targeted examination of natural gene flow between closely related species at X-linked markers with known positions would provide insight into the genetic basis of speciation. We take advantage of the existence of genomic data and a well-documented European zone of hybridization between two species of house mice, Mus domesticus and M. musculus, to conduct such a survey. We evaluate patterns of introgression across the hybrid zone for 13 diagnostic X-linked loci with known chromosomal positions using a maximum likelihood model. Interlocus comparisons clearly identify one locus with reduced introgression across the center of the hybrid zone, pinpointing a candidate region for reproductive isolation. Results also reveal one locus with high frequencies of M. domesticus alleles in populations on the M. musculus side of the zone, suggesting the possibility that positive selection may act to drive the spread of alleles from one species on to the genomic background of the other species. Finally, cline width and cline center are strongly positively correlated across the X chromosome, indicating that gene flow of the X chromosome may be asymmetrical. This study highlights the utility of natural populations of hybrids for mapping speciation genes and suggests that the middle of the X chromosome may be important for reproductive isolation between species of house mice.},
