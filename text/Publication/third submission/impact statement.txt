We tested whether closely related parasite species could show differences in coupling between tolerance and resistance, and found a trade-off between resistance and tolerance to one, E. falciformis, but not to its close relative E. ferrisi. Our work has direct implications for the evolutionary question of effects of parasites in hybrid zones. Moreover, we argue that the framework of resistance-tolerance coupling allows to prioritize research questions to be addressed with different parasites: broad questions of relevance for the host species as a whole with parasites showing no coupling, questions of local adaptation and host-parasite co-evolution with parasites showing coupling.
